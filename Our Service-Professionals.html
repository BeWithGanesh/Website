		<h2>Formal Wear</h2>
		&nbsp;
		<p>* A close inspection of the shirt’s collar will often give a sense for the quality of the shirt. A quality collar will be cut perfectly symmetrical, with straight and clean stitching along the edges.   If the collar is a fused collar, then it should have a nice crispness to it, with sharp, clean edges along the bottom. Bending the collar, it should feel flexible and resilient.  It should not feel like paper or board that can be creased. The collar should naturally curve in a circle when buttoned and not be prone to hold some unnatural shape. The stiffness and weight of the collar is not necessarily a sign of poor quality, but rather an element of design.</p>
		&nbsp;

		<p>* A sure-fire sign of a high quality shirt construction is the split yoke. The shirt yoke is the panel of fabric that runs across the shoulders, just behind the collar.</p>
		&nbsp;

		<p>* We won’t go into this too much in this post, because dress shirt fabrics is a deep subject with varying opinions on thread count, ply, country of origin, mill, type of weave, yarn treatment, materials, etc. But suffice it to say, the quality of the fabric is very, very important to the quality of the shirt. Generally speaking, fabrics with thread count of 80s two-ply or greater are a great quality, though there are many exceptions on both sides of this rule. We’re generally a bit skeptical of 50s single-ply fabrics, very skeptical of 40s single-ply fabric, and very, very skeptical of anything with a polyester blend.</p>

		<h2>Ethnic Wear</h2>
		&nbsp;
		<p>* Kurta pyjama: It is a very simple and the best choice for men. Experiment with a velvet kurta or a silk embroidered kurta. A silk kurta in a single shade with a plain pyjama can make you look really attractive. Try with different and bright colours as it will add a spark to your look.</p>
		&nbsp;
		

		<p> * Jodhpur pants and kurtas: They never go out of style and can make you center of attraction. It is blend of style with comfort quotient.</p>

		&nbsp;

		<p>* Denims with kurta: If it is a get together with your friends, try to add an ethnic touch to your look. Wear a dark or bright coloured kurta along with a pair of jeans to make yourself stand out of the rest.</p>
		&nbsp;


		<p>* Pathani suit: A well-fitted pathani suit in different colours is a must in the wardrobe.</p>
		&nbsp;

		<p>* Dhoti: Wearing a dhoti is itself an adventure. Ditch your formal wears, and team up a kurta with a dhoti for a traditional look, and to make a style statement.</p>
		&nbsp;

		<p>* Accessories are not only for women. You can go for broche, pocket squares, dupattas or bracelets</p>
